# TRUST implementation

This is my implementation of TRUST based on the paper [TRUST: An Accurate and End-to-End Table structure Recognizer Using Splitting-based Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14687). It is a work in progress. I also provide preprocessing for [the PubTabNet dataset](https://github.com/ibm-aur-nlp/PubTabNet) to work with the TRUST model.
Results for the general preprocessing for PubTabNet can be found in sample1.json.
